# Final Presentations

## When: During class Wednesday Week 10

## How long: 5 Minutes

## What should it cover?

Your presentation should be a brief "cooking show" style introduction to your program.

* Introduce the program via the readme: 1-2 Minutes
* Walk the class through the Vignette: 1-2 Minutes
* Present the results of the program / Shiny app: 1-2 Minutes
* Answer questions: the remaining time

_The time devoted to each section will depend on your program._

If you are working in a group, all group members must participate in the presentation.

Your program does not have to be perfect at the time of the presentation.  This is an opportunity to get feedback on your program and to show your peers what you have accomplished.  You will have an additional week to incorporate comments and suggestions to make you program as amazing as possible!
