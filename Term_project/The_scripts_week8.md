# Discussion Week 8: Continuing to write scripts

So by now you have the core function of your project figured out and you have pseudocode to tie the functions together.   

Today in discussion, you are going to work on the code that strings it all together.  

There is a folder on GitHub ```https://github.com/pceeb/UCLA_Spring_2019/tree/master/Term_project/Example_scripts``` that contains useful scripts that you can incorporate into your project.  

There is also a folder on GitHub ```https://github.com/pceeb/UCLA_Spring_2019/tree/master/Term_project/Example_data``` that includes example taxonomy data for the 'fishbase' like projects.

# _Just as a final friendly reminder:_

Your projects should be able to run on Hoffman2.

You will have the opportunity to tell us how much work you think that your teammate(s) did at the end of the project.  We will take that into consideration when grades are determined.  If you have been slacking, now is the time to make a change.
