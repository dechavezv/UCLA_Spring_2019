# Discussion Week 9: Writing the Vignette

So by you should have the majority of your program finished.

Today in discussion, you are going to write the Vignette -the example "How to" for running your program. This should include text that explains how to run the program, example input and expected output files. See https://github.com/limey-bean/Anacapa/tree/New-Master/Example_data/ as an example.  

Next week in discussion your peers are going to test out your programs and provide feedback.  They will need to be able to run your program and be able to verify that they got the expected output.  Your Vignette should provide everything they need to do this.

# _Just as a final friendly reminder:_

There is a folder on GitHub ```https://github.com/pceeb/UCLA_Spring_2019/tree/master/Term_project/Example_scripts``` that contains useful scripts that you can incorporate into your project.  

There is also a folder on GitHub ```https://github.com/pceeb/UCLA_Spring_2019/tree/master/Term_project/Example_data``` that includes example taxonomy data for the 'fishbase' like projects.


Your projects should be able to run on Hoffman2.

You will have the opportunity to tell us how much work you think that your teammate(s) did at the end of the project.  We will take that into consideration when grades are determined.  If you have been slacking, now is the time to make a change.
