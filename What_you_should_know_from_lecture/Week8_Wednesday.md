### Today in class

We are going to revisit Regular Expressions!

Regular expressions are used in programing languages, and they are not always applied the same way. Meaning they do not always all work for every language.  Today you are going to do a general tutorial about regular expressions.  Not everything that you do today will work in bash or python, but most will work in a text editor.

Go through the tutorial (all 14 exercises) found at https://regexone.com/ .


### In class exercises


Make a text file (.txt) called <your_initials>\_Week8_Wednesday.txt that includes the solution to all 14 exercises.  The solution is the regular expression that causes the continue button to change to the color green and gives you check marks next to the patterns that you are supposed to match.

Copy the final .txt document to the ```/u/home/class/c177/c177-i0/classdata/In_class/Week8/Wednesday/``` directory.
